Visma has published Responsible Disclosure Policies, use Bug Bounties and have several full time Hackers employed as part of their Application Security Program called VASP. They encourage their developers to " Be curious, challenge the existing and hack your own systems" since "A known vulnerability is at least possible to fix, while an unknown vulnerability is, well unknown and therefore rather tricky to fix" :-)
