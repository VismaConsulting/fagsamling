In his mid 20s, Jamie Woodruff is one of the world’s leading authorities on hacking and cyber security.

Woodruff entered the public eye when he successfully hacked Facebook as part of a student competition at Bangor University where he was studying computer information systems. He has since uncovered security holes in numerous high-profile operations, including Kim Kardashian’s website, which he hacked to reveal that it was putting her fans’ data at serious risk.

Jamie Woodruff is currently Chief technology Officer of an IT Support and Security specialist company in the UK. They specialise in training, cloud solutions, penetration testing and support schools with a full range of IT. He is also the cyber safety advisor for the Cyber Smile Foundation which specialises in online cyber bullying.

Woodruff talks about the importance of system and network security and is known for disclosing world-wide exploits and vulnerabilities within leading security applications such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Apple and Google. He finds existing exploits by infiltrating the companies in question. He demonstrated this by impersonating a Domino’s pizza delivery boy at a large financial institution and gaining access to their server room via pick-locking. All carried out under fully authorised, ethical penetration testing.

Jamie Woodruff also talks passionately about Cryptocurrency - explaining how it works, what to expect in the future and what it means for the future of currency and trading.
